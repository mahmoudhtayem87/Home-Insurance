# Home Insurance Quotation Calculator

An angular application which has been built to simulate the business requirement for insurance quotation, it does register the customer information in a form entry or application object “App Builder” based on the configuration.

## Configurations

- Submit Data To: used to configure where data should be stored Form Entry / Application Object
- Labels: Provide a JSON Object To Translate Your Application Labels, however you still can use the localization files and rebuild the app, but I thought that by providing the translations as a JSON object, it will save time and effort “No need to rebuild the app for a new language or a change in the current language translations”
- AutoInsuranceFormID: provide the form ID if you have selected Forms in the configuration key "Submit Data To".
- AppBuilderObjectID: provide the AppBuilder Object ID if you have selected AppBuilder in the configuration key "Submit Data To".
- Rest of Keys are mapping keys, to map the submitted data to your appBuilder Object / forms entry
